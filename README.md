# Py of Life

Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using no dependency other than Python's standard library.

Tested against Python 3.9 through 3.14.

## Installation

No need to install anything else! If you've got Python 3.9+ on your system, then just clone the repo
(or copy the content of [py_of_life.py](./py_of_life.py) over to a local file).

## Usage

```bash
python py_of_life.py <HEIGHT> <WIDTH> <ITERS>
```

The program needs three values to run, all of them integers greater than 0:

- A height `N` an a width `M` in order to create an `NxM` grid
- An amount of iterations / generations (20 generations will run per second)

For example:

```bash
python py_of_life.py 10 25 100
```

You also run `python py_of_life.py --help` to get these instructions printed to your CLI.
